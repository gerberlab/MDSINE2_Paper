# Instructions

For details, refer to the primary internal README: [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md)

As noted in that document, all scripts should be run from the `scripts` directory.
This requirement is in place to match relative pathing of the root `scripts/settings.sh` environment file, from which all other paths are defined relatively.
