# MDSINE2_figures


All scripts should be run from the ```scripts``` directory (to match relative pathing of 
the root `settings.sh` environment file.)

Pull this code via
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gibsonlab/MDSINE2_figures.git
```

## TODOs
1. include runtime benchmarks.
    - CLV
    - GLV (lasso/elasticnet/etc)
    - MDSINE2
    
2. Include runtime script that gathers all outputs from above.
